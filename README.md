## Hi there 👋  

I am a project leader working to bridge technology, art, and music. As a student at the University of Oxford, I researched user-generated content and the construction of community online. I have worked as a Project Coordinator at Vortic Art building augmented and virtual reality exhibitions with global museums, galleries, and organizations. Drawing on my background in Project Management, I implemented a new company-wide project management framework, managed communication channels across stakeholders, and identified deliverables, KPIs, and success metrics.
