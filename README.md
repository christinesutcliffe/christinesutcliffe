## Hi there 👋  

I work at the intersection of arts, culture, and technology. I leverage digital tools and my knowledge of computer science and the arts to bring music, art, audio, and key cultural moments to new audiences. 🎧  <br> 

🌱 I’m currently learning about interactivity & music in podcasting as a Master's student at the University of Oxford. 
<br><br>
🍀 I get excited about building my understanding of computer science and am working towards the Accelerated Computer Science Fundamentals Specialization offered by the University of Illinois. 
<br><br>
🌳 I completed [Google's Project Management Certificate](https://www.credly.com/badges/d5c19090-5f14-476c-9007-d219469f636c?source=linked_in_profile) and hope to apply those skills in my future work. 

#### My work experience highlights include: 

🎨 Grew public engagement in art by launching experiences on [Vortic Art’s AR/VR platform](vortic.art) by collaborating with artists, museums, galleries, and engineers
  <br><br>
🎤 Grew listeners on [The Gould Standard podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/11Fm8scsFHXj2JbDj7HZDR) (with guests including Ai Weiwei and Laurie Anderson) by 23% by leading podcast monetization, sponsorship, and feature efforts. 
  <br><br>
🎭 Advanced Canadian cultural programming by teaching over 100 workshops and community events at the Canadian Opera Company.
