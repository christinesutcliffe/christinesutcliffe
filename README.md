### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

I work at the intersection of music, art, and technology. I leverage digital tools and my knowledge of computer science and the arts to bring music, art, and key cultural moments to new audiences. <br>

Select experience highlights include: <br>

â€¢ ðŸŽ¨ Increased international representation on Vortic Artâ€™s AR/VR platform (vortic.art) by creating a catalogue of museums and foundations across 33 countries, 310 institutions, and over 200 artists. ðŸŽ¨
  <br>
â€¢ ðŸŽ¤ Grew listeners on The Gould Standard podcast (with guests including Ai Weiwei and Laurie Anderson) by 23% by leading podcast monetization, sponsorship, and feature efforts. ðŸŽ¤
  <br>
â€¢ ðŸŽ­ Advanced Canadian cultural programming by leading digital and in-person workshops at the Canadian Opera Company, reaching 1,250 audience members. ðŸŽ­
  <br>

I am also pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree at the University of Oxford (full-tuition scholarship) studying podcasting and music. I get excited about opportunities to build my understanding of computer science and am currently working towards the Accelerated Computer Science Fundamentals Specialization offered by the University of Illinois. I have previously completed Googleâ€™s Project Management certificate and aim to pursue a career that borrows from these skills. <br>
