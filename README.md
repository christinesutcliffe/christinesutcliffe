## Hi there 👋  

I am a project leader working to bridge technology, art, and music. As a student at the University of Oxford, I researched user-generated content and the construction of community online. I have worked in project management building augmented and virtual reality exhibitions with global museums, galleries, and organizations while implementing a new company-wide project management framework.
