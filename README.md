## Hi there 👋  

I am a project leader working to bridge art, music, and technology. As a student at the University of Oxford, I researched user-generated content and the construction of community online. I have worked as a project manager (including at Vortic Art) building augmented and virtual reality exhibitions with global museums, galleries, and art fairs. I'm a passionate advocate for broadening arts audiences with technology, building digital tools for creators, and advocating for women in computer science.
